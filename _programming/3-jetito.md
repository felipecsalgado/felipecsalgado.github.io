title: "Jetito"
excerpt: "Python package is designed for efficient post-processing of experimental data acquired from experiments at the JETi200 laser system at the Helmholtz Institute Jena (HIJ).<br><br>This package encompasses functionality to evaluate crucial electron beam characteristics such as charge, energy spectrum, and divergence for the different setups used at JETi200. Additionally, the package provides capabilities for far-field calculations of laser beams and the determination of geometric beam emittance using the pepper-pot method.<br><br>Jetito is highly configurable, enabling its adaptation to a wide variety of experimental setups, beyond the JETi200."
