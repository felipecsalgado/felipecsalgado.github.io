title: "Beam Emittance Evaluation Using PP"
excerpt: "GEANT4 code to simulate the emittance experiment at JETi-200 with experimental parameters obtained from measurements using a <b>pepper pot (PP)</b>. The hits of the particles (electrons, positrons, and photons) are recorded at screens placed in different positions.<br><br>A python3 jupyter notebook is provided for post-processing the data. It relies on the python package <i>uproot</i>. As requirement, please install it for using this file. One can also read the root files in different ways."
