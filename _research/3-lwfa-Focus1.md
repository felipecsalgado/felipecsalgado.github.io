title: "Laser-Driven Particle Acceleration"
excerpt: "<b>Optimization and characterization of energy, charge, bandwidth of laser-accelerated electron beams (LWFA)</b><br>

Laser wakefield accelerators (LWFAs) represent an effective alternative to conventional accelerators, primarily to their ability to accelerate electron bunches up to GeV energies within a compact setup spanning just a few centimeters in stark contrast to the several kilometers required for linear accelerators.<br><br>

Significant progress on LWFA have been made in the recent years. However, achieving beam quality comparable to that of conventional accelerators still necessitates ongoing research into critical parameters, such as beam energy and bandwidth, emittance, and stability."

objective: "Optimization and characterization of beam parameters, with the goal of achieving a sufficient level of beam quality for the next generation of compact accelerators. These advancements hold significant potential for utilization as drivers in free-electron lasers (FELs), particle colliders, Thomson sources, and numerous other applications."
